In machine learning and statistical modeling, regression analysis is a statistical process for estimating the relationships among variables. 
It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when the focus is on the relationship between a
dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or 'predictors').

##  2. Classification - 
https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/week/3
In machine learning and statistics, classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories 
(sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) 
whose category membership is known. An example would be assigning a given email into "spam" or "non-spam" classes or assigning a diagnosis to a given patient as described by observed 
characteristics of the patient (gender, blood pressure, presence or absence of certain symptoms, etc.).

## 3. Natural Language Processing -
